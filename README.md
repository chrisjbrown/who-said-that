# Who Said That
A module that when enabled asks permission to listen to the user's microphone. If granted, the module adds a listener to the microphone and analyzes the volume of the speaker and displays a speech bubble above any/all associated actors in a scene. For GM's this is any currently controlled actors in the scene.
